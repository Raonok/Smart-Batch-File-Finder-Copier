## 🚦 How It Works

1. **Set your search root** (choose which folder to start searching from).
2. **List filenames you want to find** in `input.txt` (one per line).
3. **Run the script:** all matching files are copied into a new output folder, with detailed logs created for found & missing files.

### 🔧 **Setup & Usage**

#### 1️⃣ Set the Search Destination Folder

Open `Smart-Batch-File-Finder-Copier.bat` in your text editor. (Recomanded: Notepad++) 
**Edit this line** to set your search root:
```batch
set "SEARCH_ROOT=D:\"
```

#### 2️⃣ Add Filenames to Search

- Open `Input/input.txt` in your editor. (Recomanded: Notepad++)
- Add each filename (with or without extension), **one per line**.

#### 3️⃣ Run the Script

- **Double-click** `Smart-Batch-File-Finder-Copier.bat` or run it from Command Prompt.

The script will:
- Search for all listed files in the specified folder tree.
- Copy all found files into a **newly created Output folder**, named with date & time.
- Generate two logs:  
  - `found_files.log`
  - `not_found_files.log`
- Show progress feedback in the console.

---

## ✅ Example

Suppose `input.txt` contains:
```
123.mp3
new.MP4
notes.txt
data.doc
```
- The script will recursively search from `D:\` for these files and copy any it finds.

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Don’t forget to set the correct `SEARCH_ROOT` path!**
- **List only names (and extensions) in `input.txt`, not full paths.**
- **Close `input.txt` before running the batch file to avoid access errors.**
- **Output folders are uniquely named; rerunning won’t overwrite previous results.**
